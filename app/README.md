# SKIP Streamlit Prototype

This folder contains the passenger-facing Streamlit prototype for **SKIP — Intelligent Journey Recommendation System**.

The interface demonstrates how SKIP presents journey inputs, ranked route recommendations, model confidence, PAC scores, accessibility indicators, and low-confidence compromise warnings.

> **Note:** This is the interface prototype. The complete modelling and recommendation pipeline is available in [`../notebooks/skip-modelling.ipynb`](../notebooks/skip-modelling.ipynb).

## Run Locally

From the repository root, install the project dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then start the Streamlit application:

```bash
python3 -m streamlit run app/app.py
```

The application should open automatically in your browser.

If it does not, open:

```text

To stop the application, return to the terminal and press:
